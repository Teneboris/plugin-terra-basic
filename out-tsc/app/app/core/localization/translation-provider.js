/**
 * @description A custom TranslationProvider al√† angular-l10n which uses a clean instance of the HttpClient.
 * The HttpClient instance then "dispatches the requests directly to the backend without going through the interceptor chain" that is attached to the
 * root injector. See https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpBackend#description for details.
 *
 * NOTE: This is only a workaround since angular-l10n's TranslationService uses the instance of the HttpClient from the root injector. Apparently,
 * this is the app's injector wherefore the app and the TranslationService share the same instance of the HttpClient and all registered interceptors
 * apply to the requests of the translation files. Those will eventually fail in production.
